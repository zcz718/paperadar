# PapeRadar

*Paper + Radar — a multi-source, personalized paper radar for AI-for-Science. Each week it files new work into your Obsidian/Zotero knowledge base as linked, trackable notes, and runs as a Claude Code / Codex skill.*

A weekly radar for the papers that matter to *you*. Point it at your research
interests and it sweeps the past week across arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex,
and Crossref — plus CORE and the biomedical servers (bioRxiv, medRxiv, PubMed)
when you want them — scores everything against your topics, and hands you a
ranked note, written into your Obsidian vault or as plain Markdown in any folder.

It runs as a [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code) / Codex skill,
so you can just say *"run my weekly papers"* and read the results, or drive the
scripts directly from the command line.

## Why PapeRadar

Most paper tools watch a **single source** (usually arXiv) and stop at a ranked list. PapeRadar is built for **AI-for-Science** — work that spans fields and needs more than one feed:

- **Many sources, one personalized sweep.** arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, and Crossref together (plus PubMed/bioRxiv when relevant), all scored against *your* interests — not one site's firehose.
- **Papers become knowledge, not a feed.** Results are filed into your Obsidian vault and Zotero as linked, per-paper notes — turning a week's reading into a Karpathy-style LLM wiki you can track ideas across.
- **No infrastructure.** No database, no embedding service, no web app — it runs as a Claude Code / Codex skill and uses the agent itself to judge relevance.

## What it does

- Pulls the last 7 days of new work from every source you've enabled.
- Ranks it against your keywords and arXiv categories, so the order reflects
  what you care about rather than raw popularity.
- Writes a ranked weekly note plus a short scaffold per paper (abstract, links,
  citation IDs, slots for your own notes).
- Optionally files everything in a dated Zotero collection.

Point it at machine learning, physics, economics, genomics, or whatever you
study — you describe your field once and it tunes to your topics.

## Tell the agent your research focus first

The single most useful thing you can do before your first run is describe what
you work on. Inside the skill, just tell the agent:

> "I study machine learning methods for protein structure prediction and drug
> design."

The agent turns that one sentence into your interest profile — domains,
keywords, and arXiv categories — and saves it to your config under
`research_brief`. From then on it reads that brief on every run and never asks
again. Your config file *is* the memory; the brief lives there, not in a prompt
you have to repeat.

You can revisit it any time:

> "What am I tracking?" · "Add diffusion models to my interests." · "Drop the
> economics domain."

## How it picks papers

Selection runs in two stages — wide recall, then a precise cut:

1. **Keyword retrieve.** Every enabled source is searched and scored against your
   `keywords`, `arxiv_categories`, and `priority` weights, building a ranked
   candidate pool.
2. **Relevance rerank.** Run through the agent (Claude Code / Codex), it reads
   each candidate against your `research_brief`, keeps the genuinely on-topic
   ones, drops papers that only brushed a keyword, and backfills from the pool so
   your note still comes out full. Run headless (cron, no agent) and it falls
   back to the keyword ranking.

The keyword layer casts a wide net; the brief-aware rerank tightens it. A clear
`research_brief` is what makes that second stage sharp.

## Getting started

Three steps: install it, tell it what you study, run it weekly.

### 1. Install

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and symlink it into whichever runner you use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zcz718/paperadar.git
cd paperadar
pip install -r requirements.txt

ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/skills/paperadar      # Claude Code
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.codex/skills/paperadar       # Codex (optional)
```

`SKILL.md` finds its own directory at runtime, so one copy works under both.

> **Dependencies.** Install the requirements into the interpreter the skill will
> use (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`). If your default `python3`
> doesn't have them, point the skill at the right one with
> `export PAPERADAR_PYTHON=/path/to/python`. The skill preflight-checks this and
> fails loudly with instructions if anything is missing.

### 2. Tell it what you study

Run the setup wizard — or just ask the agent "set me up". Both write the same config:

```bash
python scripts/init_config.py
```

It asks for your research brief (one sentence on what you work on), whether you
use Obsidian and Zotero, and where notes should go. That one sentence is what
makes the picks sharp — see [Tell the agent your research focus](#tell-the-agent-your-research-focus-first).

### 3. Run it

Invoke it any of three ways:

- **Slash command** — type `/paperadar` (works in both Claude Code and Codex).
- **Natural language** — "run my weekly recommendations", "what am I tracking?"
- **Codex `$` form** — `$paperadar` also triggers it explicitly in Codex.

## Configuration

Everything lives in one YAML file (`config.example.yaml` is the template).

**Output mode.** `obsidian` writes wikilinked notes into a vault; `standalone`
writes plain Markdown into a folder of your choice — no vault required.

**Research domains.** Named groups of `keywords`, `arxiv_categories`, and a
`priority` (1–5). The union of all your `arxiv_categories` decides which arXiv
papers get fetched, so adding `physics.comp-ph` or `econ.GN` is all it takes to
follow a new field. `priority` (3 is neutral) weights how a topic's matches
rank — a priority-5 topic rises to the top, a priority-1 topic sinks — without
ever excluding a relevant paper.

**Relevance, not source tiers.** Every accessible source is searched, and a
paper surfaces on keyword relevance — not on which site it came from (a
biophysics paper in PubMed still reaches a physicist). What it takes to be
included is a real keyword match (about one title hit); what it takes to rank
near the top is that match landing in a high-`priority` topic.

**Sources.** Every source is a peer: each is searched and re-scored the same
way, and which site a paper comes from never changes its rank (see *Relevance,
not source tiers* above). They differ only in whether they need a key or a
signal to switch on:

| Setting | Source | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| _(always on)_ | arXiv | No key. Preprints in the arXiv categories your config lists. |
| _(always on)_ | Semantic Scholar | No key. High-citation papers from the past year. |
| `crossref.enabled: auto` | Crossref (~180M DOIs, all fields) | On by default — no key needed. Catches freshly-registered papers across every field, often before aggregators index them. |
| `bio_sources: auto` | bioRxiv, medRxiv, PubMed | Included automatically when your topics look biomedical (a `q-bio.*` category or a biomedical keyword), so non-biomedical fields stay clean. Set `true` to always search them, `false` to never. |
| `openalex.enabled: auto` | OpenAlex (~270M works, all fields) | Needs `OPENALEX_API_KEY` ([free](https://openalex.org), under a minute) — a key is required to reach OpenAlex at all. Skipped silently without one. |
| `core.enabled: false` | CORE (~400M OA works) | Open-access repositories — theses, working papers, deposits. Off by default: CORE surfaces recently-deposited (not newly-published) work that rarely changes a weekly list. Turn on with `auto`/`true` plus `CORE_API_KEY` ([free](https://core.ac.uk/services/api)). |

Adding a source only ever widens coverage — every result lands in one schema and
competes on relevance alone.

**Journal filter.** `prioritize_journals` restricts PubMed and Semantic Scholar
to a list of venues (journals or conferences). Preprints, OpenAlex, Crossref,
and CORE are never filtered, so nothing cutting-edge gets dropped. Leave it
empty to disable.

**Scoring (advanced).** The defaults are tuned, but an optional `scoring:` block
lets you set them from YAML instead of editing source: `min_relevance` (the
inclusion gate — lower to see more), `min_keyword_matches` (distinct keyword hits
a paper needs — `1` by default so the net stays wide and the rerank does the
precision; raise to `2` for a stricter keyword-only cut on headless runs), the
title/abstract/category match weights, the recency buckets, and the `weights:`
that blend the final ranking. See the commented block in `config.example.yaml`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` | Obsidian mode | Root of your vault |
| `OPENALEX_API_KEY` | OpenAlex source | Free; unset = source skipped |
| `OPENALEX_EMAIL` | OpenAlex (optional) | Joins the faster "polite pool" |
| `CORE_API_KEY` | CORE source | Free; unset = source skipped |
| `CROSSREF_EMAIL` | Crossref (optional) | Polite pool; falls back to `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` |
| `NCBI_API_KEY` | PubMed (optional) | Raises the rate limit 3→10 req/s |
| `ZOTERO_API_KEY`, `ZOTERO_USER_ID` | Zotero sync | `ZOTERO_USER_ID` is the numeric ID |
| `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` | Unpaywall PDF fetch | Their ToS requires a contact email |
| `PAPERADAR_PYTHON` | Pinning the interpreter | Use if default `python3` lacks deps |

Keys exported in your shell rc files are picked up automatically, even from
non-interactive runners.
