"""Shared keyword-collection helper for paperradar source adapters.

OpenAlex, Crossref, and CORE each build their query string from the same raw
material: every keyword across all of the config's ``research_domains``, in
order, case-insensitively de-duplicated, with too-short noise terms dropped.
They differ only in how they *format* those terms (OR-joined and quoted /
space-joined / wrapped in an Elasticsearch group), so the collection step lives
here and each adapter formats the returned list itself.
